email-as-username
=================

This is a simple Joomla System plugin to remove the need for a username for registration and login.

At registration, a unique username is generated from the supplied Name value or Email address (depending on the selected parameter value). This can be changed after registration.

## Template Overrides

Simple template overrides for the login form and login module have been supplied in the com_users and mod_login folders. These folders do not install with the plugin, and should be placed in the usual folder, ie: templates/your_template/html/
